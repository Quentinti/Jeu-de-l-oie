Start a game of Goose:
Each player plays his turn by throwing the two dice. Depending on the number or the number obtained, the player advances his pawn box by box.
There are rules of the game of Goose to respect according to the number that one makes or the box on which one falls.
Let's take a closer look at these rules:
☼ At the beginning of the game, if one of the players rolls 9 by 6 and 3, he must advance his pawn immediately to the number 26. If he does 9 by 4 and 5, he will go to the number 53.
☼ If during the game, the player falls on a goose, he advances again the number of points made.
☼ If a player rolls 6, he must go to square 12.
☼ The player who falls on box 19 corresponding to a hotel must pass his turn during 2 turns.
☼ The player who falls on box 31 corresponding to the well will wait for another player to arrive at the same number and take his place.
☼ Whoever falls on box 42 corresponding to the labyrinth will necessarily return to box 30.
☼ Who goes in 52 matching the prison will wait for another player to come to the same number to leave.
☼ The player who goes to box 58 corresponding to the box Death's Head will start the game again from the beginning
☼ Whoever is joined by another player on the same box will have to go to the box where the other player was before playing.
How to win a game of Goose:
To win a game of Goose, you must be the first to arrive on the last box 63 but with the obligation to arrive right on this box.
In case the player makes a dice score higher than the number of spaces separating him from the victory, he will have to move back by as many additional boxes.
